Everything runs from **this folder** (`Salinity 2`).

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Data.xlsx` | Your dataset (preferred location) |
| `app.py` | Streamlit UI |

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.9+ (tested with 3.9)
- **pip**: installed with Python

## Install (once)

From this folder:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

- **UI (recommended):** double-click `run_ui.bat`
  - or:

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

- **CLI:** double-click `run_cli.bat`
  - or:

```bash
python Salinity_2.py --runs 30 --algorithm random_forest
```

If `python` is not recognized in PowerShell, use the Windows launcher:

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py -m streamlit run app.py
py Salinity_2.py
```

## Data notes

- The app creates the label from **`Ece mean`** using your chosen threshold.
- The code automatically blocks ID/leakage columns from being used as features.
- If you replace `Data.xlsx` with a new dataset, keep the same column names (or update `config.py`).

## UI tabs

| Tab | What you control |
|-----|------------------|
| **Data** | Preview rows and class balance |
| **Features** | Drop columns *or* use only selected columns |
| **Hyperparameters** | Full sklearn settings per algorithm (save/load JSON) |
| **Run** | Results, feature importance chart, JSON export |

**Sidebar:** resampling, SMOTE neighbors, hold-out vs stratified CV, auto-tune decision threshold for recall/F1.


## What this tool does (research workflow)
This app trains a **binary classifier** for salinity using your spreadsheet features and a label derived from:

- **Target column**: `Ece mean`
- **Label rule**: class **1 (saline)** if \(Ece\_mean \ge\) **Ece threshold**, else class **0**

Because the dataset can be **highly imbalanced** (very few saline samples), you should focus on:
- **Recall (saline)**: how many saline profiles you detect
- **Balanced accuracy**: accuracy averaged across classes
- **F1**: balance of precision/recall when you care about false alarms too

## How to use the UI
### 1) Data tab
- Confirm the file loads and columns look correct.
- Adjust the **Ece threshold** and watch how the **class balance** changes.

### 2) Features tab (choose which columns are used)
You have two modes:
- **Exclude mode**: use all allowed columns except the ones you drop.
- **Include mode**: use **only** the selected columns (best when you want full control).

Notes:
- ID columns and leakage columns (like `Ece mean`) are automatically blocked from training.
- “Spectral only” is a fast way to avoid geographic memorization (longitude/latitude/year) and categorical soil/LU columns.

### 3) Hyperparameters tab (full algorithm control)
- Modify every hyperparameter exposed for the chosen algorithm.
- **Save hyperparameters (JSON)** to create a reproducible “model preset”.
- Load a saved JSON later (or share it with another researcher).

### 4) Run tab (evaluation + export)
Evaluation options:
- **Repeated random hold-out**: repeatedly split train/validation and average metrics.
- **Stratified k-fold CV**: splits data into k folds with similar class ratios; better when positives are rare.

Decision threshold options:
- **Fixed threshold**: predicts saline when \(P(saline)\ge\) threshold (default 0.5).
- **Auto-tune threshold**: searches probability cutoffs on each validation fold to maximize **recall** or **F1**.

Exports:
- Download a JSON containing the full config, summary metrics, selected features, and feature importance (when available).

## Training controls (what they mean)
### Resampling (SMOTE / ADASYN)
Used **only on the training split** to reduce class imbalance.

- **none**: no oversampling; rely on class weighting (if the algorithm supports it).
- **SMOTE**: creates synthetic minority samples by interpolating neighbors.
  - **neighbors (k)**: larger k makes smoother synthetic samples; too large can create unrealistic points when the minority class is tiny.
- **ADASYN**: like SMOTE but generates more synthetic samples where the minority class is harder to learn (near boundaries).
  - can help, but may also amplify noise when data is very small.

### Standardize features
Normalization (z-score scaling) is important for distance-based / margin-based models:
- **SVM** and **KNN** usually benefit strongly.
- Tree models (Random Forest / Extra Trees / Gradient Boosting) are less sensitive.

## Algorithms: how they work, when to use them, and hyperparameters
Below, “positive class” means **saline (1)**.

### 1) Random Forest (`random_forest`)
**How it works**: trains many decision trees on bootstrapped samples; averages votes. Handles non-linear feature interactions well.

**When to use**: strong default on tabular data, robust, gives feature importance.

**Hyperparameters**
- **n_estimators (trees)**: more trees → more stable, slower.
- **max_depth**: limits tree depth. Lower values reduce overfitting on small datasets.
- **min_samples_split**: minimum samples to split a node. Higher → smoother/less complex trees.
- **min_samples_leaf**: minimum samples in a leaf. Higher → less variance, often better generalization.
- **max_features**:
  - `sqrt` (common): decorrelates trees, usually good default.
  - `log2`: similar, slightly fewer features per split.
  - `all`: strongest splits, but trees become more similar → can overfit.
- **class_weight**:
  - `balanced`: increases penalty for misclassifying the rare class; often improves recall.
  - `none`: can increase accuracy but often collapses recall when positives are rare.
- **bootstrap**: if enabled, each tree sees a bootstrap sample → more diversity.

### 2) Extra Trees (`extra_trees`)
**How it works**: like Random Forest but splits are more randomized; often faster and sometimes generalizes better.

**When to use**: strong alternative to Random Forest; can be more stable with very small data.

**Hyperparameters**: same meaning as Random Forest.

### 3) Gradient Boosting (`gradient_boosting`)
**How it works**: builds trees sequentially; each new tree corrects errors of the previous ensemble.

**When to use**: can be very accurate, but is easier to overfit on tiny or noisy data.

**Hyperparameters**
- **n_estimators**: more stages → more capacity; combine with smaller learning rate.
- **learning_rate**: shrink contribution of each tree.
  - smaller → usually needs more estimators, but often generalizes better.
- **max_depth**: depth of each weak learner tree.
- **min_samples_split / min_samples_leaf**: regularization, same concept as RF.
- **subsample**: < 1.0 enables stochastic boosting (adds regularization).

### 4) Logistic Regression (`logistic_regression`)
**How it works**: linear decision boundary in feature space; outputs probabilities via sigmoid.

**When to use**: baseline, interpretable, good when signal is mostly linear; works well with scaling.

**Hyperparameters**
- **C**: inverse of regularization strength.
  - smaller C → stronger regularization → simpler model.
- **penalty**:
  - `l2`: smooth shrinkage (default).
  - `l1`: sparse coefficients (feature selection effect).
  - `elasticnet`: mix of l1/l2 (requires solver `saga`).
- **solver**: optimization method; some solvers support only some penalties.
- **max_iter**: increase if convergence warnings occur.
- **class_weight**: `balanced` usually improves minority recall.

### 5) Support Vector Machine (`svm_rbf`)
**How it works**: finds a separating boundary with maximum margin; RBF kernel creates a non-linear boundary.

**When to use**: small datasets where scaling is possible; can work well with few positives but needs careful tuning.

**Hyperparameters**
- **C**: trade-off between margin size and training errors.
  - higher C fits training data more tightly (risk overfitting).
  - lower C is smoother (may improve generalization).
- **kernel**:
  - `rbf`: non-linear (default).
  - `linear`: linear boundary (faster).
  - `poly`: polynomial boundary (rarely needed here).
- **gamma**:
  - `scale` (recommended): adapts to feature variance.
  - `auto`: uses 1 / n_features; sometimes too aggressive/too weak.
- **class_weight**: `balanced` often required to get any recall on rare positives.

### 6) K-Nearest Neighbors (`knn`)
**How it works**: predicts based on the labels of the closest points in feature space.

**When to use**: quick baseline; can work if classes cluster well; sensitive to scaling and noise.

**Hyperparameters**
- **n_neighbors (k)**:
  - small k → sensitive, can overfit.
  - larger k → smoother, may miss rare positives.
- **weights**:
  - `uniform`: each neighbor equally weighted.
  - `distance`: closer points matter more; often better.
- **p**:
  - 1 = Manhattan distance; 2 = Euclidean distance (default).

### 7) Gaussian Naive Bayes (`naive_bayes`)
**How it works**: assumes each feature is conditionally independent given the class and normally distributed.

**When to use**: very small datasets; quick baseline; can perform surprisingly well but assumptions may be violated.

**Hyperparameters**
- **var_smoothing**: adds small variance to stabilize numerical behavior.
  - larger smoothing can prevent overconfidence but can underfit.

## Recommended defaults (for your current class imbalance)
If saline samples are extremely rare:
1. Use **Stratified k-fold CV** (3–5 folds) and multiple runs.
2. Enable **Auto-tune threshold → recall**.
3. Start with **Random Forest** or **Extra Trees**, `class_weight=balanced`, and shallow `max_depth` (3–8).
4. Use SMOTE carefully: keep **neighbors (k)** small when minority class count is tiny.

## CLI usage (same pipeline, no UI)
```bash
python Salinity_2.py --runs 30 --algorithm random_forest
```

Tip: for research reproducibility, keep a fixed `--seed`, and save the UI hyperparameters as JSON.
